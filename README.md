# Emulsify: Pattern Lab + Drupal 8

Component-driven prototyping tool using [Pattern Lab v2](http://patternlab.io/) automated via Gulp/NPM. Also serves as _a starterkit_ Drupal 8 theme.

## Requirements

1.  [PHP 7.1](http://www.php.net/)
2.  [Node (we recommend NVM)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
3.  [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
4.  [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
5.  Optional: [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

## Prototyping (separate from Drupal, Wordpress, etc.)

Emulsify supports both NPM and YARN.

Install with NPM:
`composer create-project fourkitchens/emulsify:^3.0 --stability dev --no-interaction emulsify && cd emulsify && npm install`

Install with Yarn:
`composer create-project fourkitchens/emulsify:^3.0 --stability dev --no-interaction emulsify && cd emulsify && yarn install`

## Drupal installation

### In a Composer-based Drupal install (recommended)

1. Require emulsify in your project `composer require fourkitchens/emulsify`
2. Move into the original emulsify theme `cd web/themes/contrib/emulsify/`
3. Create your new theme by cloning emulsify `php emulsify.php "THEME NAME"` (Run `php emulsify.php -h` for other available options)
4. Move into your theme directory `cd web/themes/custom/THEME_NAME/`
5. Install the theme dependencies `npm install` or `yarn install`
6. Enable your theme and its dependencies `drush then THEME_NAME -y && drush en components unified_twig_ext -y`
7. Proceed to the "Starting Pattern Lab…" section below

If you're not using a Composer-based Drupal install (e.g. tarball download from drupal.org) installation [instructions can be found on the Wiki](https://github.com/fourkitchens/emulsify/wiki/Install-(without-Composer)).

Troubleshooting Installation: See [Drupal Installation FAQ](https://github.com/fourkitchens/emulsify/wiki/Install-(Composer)#drupal-installation-faq).

_Note: Once you've created your custom theme, you can remove Emulsify as a dependency of your project. If you'd like to get updates as we push them, solely for educational/best-practice information, feel free to leave it in and receive the updates. Updating Emulsify will not affect your custom theme in any way._

## Starting Pattern Lab and watch task

The `start` command spins up a local server, compiles everything (runs all required gulp tasks), and watches for changes.

1.  `npm start` or `yarn start`
